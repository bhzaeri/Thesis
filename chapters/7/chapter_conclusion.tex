\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, two novel strategies were introduced to improve the robustness of CAs in both population and belief spaces. In the first strategy, a new neighborhood restructuring strategy is employed which aims at individuals with irregular and heterogeneous neighborhood structures. There is no centralized coordinator to control the topology of a population because the individuals are responsible for inspecting and modifying their neighborhood in a self-organized manner. Increasing the level of self-organization and autonomy is a key approach to improving robustness in a complex system.  In the second strategy, the standard implementation of normative ranges in the belief space was replaced by the confidence intervals inspired from Inferential Statistics. The new knowledge source shows a more robust search behavior to fluctuations in the input data. Now, the size of normative ranges does not change dramatically with any temporal fluctuations.\newline
The performance of both proposed approaches is assessed through a test-suite of 15 multi-modal and hybrid functions from IEEE-CEC2015. Both methods are compared to the original version of the social fabric based CA \cite{ali2016leveraged}. The results show improvement in almost all of the functions. In some of them, the results are quite promising. Future work might be investigating the improved robustness of proposed approaches to dynamic problems or even real-world problems such as dynamic problems, data classification and social network analysis.

\section{Future Work}

%My first rule for this chapter is to avoid finishing it with a section talking about future work. It may seem logical, yet it also appears to give a list of all items which remain undone! It is not the best way psychologically.

%This chapter should contain a mirror of the introduction, where a summary of the \textit{extraordinary} new results and their wonderful attributes should be stated first, followed by an executive summary of how this new solution was arrived at. Consider the practical fact that this chapter will be read quickly at the beginning of a review (thus it needs to provide a strong impact) and then again in depth at the very end, perhaps a few days after the details of the previous 3 chapters have been somehow forgotten. Reinforcement of the positive is the key strategy here, without of course blowing hot air.

%One other consideration is that some people like to join the chapter containing the analysis with the only with conclusions. This can indeed work very well in certain topics.

%Finally, the conclusions do not appear only in this chapter. This sample mini thesis lacks a feature which I regard as absolutely necessary, namely a short paragraph at the end of each chapter giving a brief summary of what was presented together with a one sentence preview as to what might expect the connection to be with the next chapter(s). You are writing a story, the \textit{story of your wonderful research work}. A story needs a line connecting all its parts and you are responsible for these linkages.
