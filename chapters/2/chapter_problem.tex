Many variants of CAs have been proposed in a vast range of different applications such as single and multi-objective optimization, dynamic problems, social interactions simulation. Here, we are interested in studying socially motivated and multi-population variants as some modern approaches in solving optimization problems.
\subsection{Heterogeneous Multi-Population Cultural Algorithm}
[] proposed a new architecture for cultural algorithms. In this pproach, the whole population is divided into a set of independent sub-populations which work in parallel without direct communication. They referred to the works of [] [] [] []. As their motivation they stated that most of proposed variants of evolutionary algorithms suffers from immature convergence. This occurs because these algorithms can not hold the diversity at a reasonable level. Based on existing research works, they hypothesized that multi-population streategies would be a better choice as they have the potential to perfrom an efficient search on complex landscapes. In their approach, the optimization parameters are divided among some heterogenous sub-populations. the sub-populations are called heterogenous because each sub-population is responsible for optimizing a different subset of parameters. Each sub-population represents a partial solution instead of a complete solution. To evaluate a partial solution, it gets completed by its complement parameter values from the belief space. The complete solution is evaluated based on a numerical optimization function. Also, to make the convergence process faster a simple local search strategy is incorporated into the proppsed algorithm. The general architecture of their algorithm is presented in figure ???\newline
In the experiments, they considered the whole population size to be 1000 individuals. It is divided into 30 sub-populations. So, the size of each sub-popualtion is 33. The algorithm runs for the maximum of 10000 generations and the local search strategy runs only for 10 iterations. They evaluated HMP-CA on a set of 8 complex optimization functions. It is able to find the minimum value for 7 functions out of 8. However, when the local search strategy is applied to the expriments, the proposed method outperforms all of the functions and it finds the optimum value very quickly. Ultimately, they claimed that their porpsed approach is efficient in both time and space complexity.

\subsection{The Social Fabric Approach as an Approach to Knowledge Integration in Cultural Algorithms}	
[] begins with a brief introduction to socially motivated methods to problem solving. It compares qualities of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Cultural Algorithms (CA) regarding the scale in which the interactions between agents occur. Figure (()) compares PSO, ACO, and CA in terms of the time and space continuum over which the social interactions occur. Individuals in ACO and PSO tend to interact in a reatively limited temporal and spatial scales. It is obvious because the agents in both ant and paricle swarm algorithms exchange information with only other agents in their local neighborhood. On the other hand, cultural algorithms let the individuals interact together using various types of symbolic information emerged from complex cultural systems. In cultural algorithms the interactions among individuals occur indirectly through a shared belief space. So, cultural algorithms allow individuals interact in a global scale.\newline
Then, they asked the essential question of what social structures might emerege alongisde the search process?. To answer such questions, they introduced a new influence function which utilizes the social fabric phenomena. The old influence function assumes no interactions between agents and works based on the simple roulete wheel method. On the other hand, in the new influence function, the individuals are connected through a social network (fabric). Multiple layers of such networks could be employed in a population. The interplay of these network connection forms a social fabric. At each iteration, an individual could specify its controller knowledge source. In this approach, the contoller knowledge source is chosen based on the majority of knowledge sources in the neighborhood of an individual. The neighborhood size of an individual is specified by the topology of the fabric. Inspired by Particle Swarm Optimization literature, different topologies could be taken into consideration to model the relationships among individuals. In their work, they only considered Ring and Square topologies. They stated that, the topology of the social fabric determines the extent to which the influence of knowledge sources could be spread thorugh the network.\newline
To evaluate the social fabric approach, they implemented it in Repast frameork. Repast is a simuation tool for multi-agent systems. They created a cultual algorithms toolkit (CAT) to view the capabilities of cultural algorithms in solving various problems. They chose Cone World problem to evaluate and compare their approach with the standard cultural algorithm. The reason that they chose this problem is that by changing its parameters during the evolution process, it can show a dynamic behavior. So, Cone World problem provides an efficient way to test flexibility of search algorithms. They set the parameters of CAT as: 100 individuals, 100 cones and 1000 generations. They used ring and square topologies to from he social fabric. They stated that square topology works better than ring as it finds the solution after 250 iterations. While, the ring topology finds the best solution 450 iterations.
\subsection{Robust Evolution Optimization at the Edge of Chaos: Commercialization of Culture Algorithms}
The authors of [] aimed at commercializing Cultural Algorithm Toolkit (CAT) thourgh developing a robust variant of it. By robustness, they mean to develop a cultural algorithm which is capable of being applied across a vast range of complex problems. At first, they referred to [Peng model] as an standard model cultural algorithms which assumes no connection between individuals. Then, they referred to [Ali], which introduced the concept of social fabric to allow individuals interact together. The authors extended the work of Ali

Here is where you tell me what is the problem you have been working on for the past few months (or years). I want all the details and you should not be timid about being too tutorial, except that you do not want to cross the line towards writing a textbook. However consider carefully that \textit{communication} implies conveying ideas to other people, while \textit{effective communication} occurs when your message is clearly understood. Remember that your audience must understand your message before they can agree with you.

Ask yourself:
\textit{who is your audience?} You might think of your supervisor who knows everything and you want to impress with your knowledge. I think instead of the graduate students who will be reading this thesis which is, after all, a property of the university. It is published as a university technical report so that others may learn by reading it. Then teach them! Be a bit tutorial. Even the expert external examiner will be impressed by your clarity of exposition if he or she does not need to read paragraphs twice in order to understand - something which people with PhDs and big egos find particularly irritating.

On the other hand, do not go too far and give trivial definitions from concepts learned in a 3rd year undergraduate courses, else you might find yourself in trouble when having to remember the details during an oral examination.

My approach is to put everything necessary to make clarity for
the problem the main goal of this chapter, assuming an intelligent and well prepared reader who already has a Bachelor degree in an appropriate subject.

Once I understand the problem clearly and its nuances (it may not be what I expected after all), I also need to know why the problem is important, what its impact is and what its application, if any. Here you are free to elaborate and write as much as you think is necessary to avoid the examination doubt that you have a brilliant new solution to a trivial and unimportant issue.

I suggest reading various books on how to do research and set up problems. The best for me was "The Craft of Research" by Wayne Booth \cite{booth1}, which can be found in the main library at Q180.55 M4B66. From there I have transferred to my writing a fairly simple structure for talking about the topic of the research, with the question to be asked and its motivation and significance. It goes as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\textit{I am trying to learn about (working on, studying...)}}
\item {\textit{because I want to find out....}}
\item {\textit{in order to understand...}}
\end{enumerate}

Another way of looking at this is to ask the
\textit{what}, \textit{why} and \textit{where}, starting from a \textit{setting} of the problem with a first point A, stating what the \textit{goal} is at point B and having an \textit{action link} between the two which will encompass your new solution. As surprising as this may be to some of you, I found reading a book from Microsoft very useful: "Beyond Bullet Points: Using Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2007 to Create Presentations That Inform" \cite {atkin}. The goal of the book is to improve presentations with Power Point, but there is a lot that can be transferred towards \textit{effective communication} for a thesis.

In summary, my view of the second chapter on
\textit{"The Problem to be solved"} is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\textit{Not} all the background and definitions (boring!) - use instead just-in-time explanations as needed in every context as it comes up;}
\item {Motivation in depth;}
\item {Tutorial high level explanation, where it is important to choose the right pitch: who is the audience? who are you teaching here?}
\item {Make it exciting, make it current, make it important - why do I want to keep reading?}
\item {Should you list here the solutions from other researchers? I think not, list instead the different facets of the problems that other researchers have attacked.}
\item {A taxonomy can be extremely useful to place your problem and its particular special features within the perfect context of the overall area, as you need to make sure that the reader understands perfectly what you are trying to solve.}
\end{enumerate}
