	\section{Evolutionary Algorithms}
Evolutionary algorithms take their roots from the evolution theory of Darwin. These algorithms try to mimic the collective behavior of natural systems. Natural processes such as natural selection, survival of the fittest, and reproduction have been subject to inspiration as the fundamental components of evolutionary problem-solving methods. The basic part of all these algorithms is that they start with a randomly generated set of solutions. Then, they try to evolve the solutions through applying a set evolutionary operators such as mutation and crossover. \newline
Evolutionary algorithms are not limited to biological processes. There is another category of evolutionary algorithms known as Swarm Intelligence (SI). These algorithms take inspiration from social behaviors of living colonies such as ants, flocks, schools, and hives. Within these swarms, individuals have relatively simple structures, but their collective behavior usually looks very complex. The complex behavior of a swarm emerges as a result of the interactions between the individuals over time. This complex behavior can not be easily predicted by observing the simple behaviors of the agents separately. \newline
There are some well-known examples categorized as evolutionary algorithms:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Genetic Algorithms
	\item Cultural Algorithms
	\item Prticle Swarm Optimization
	\item Ant Colony Optimization
	\item Honey Bee Colony
\end{enumerate}
Both categories of evolutionary algorithms share the same idea of evolving some initially generated solutions. However, the difference is in the way that they manipulate and evolve individuals through applying evolutionary operators. 
\section{Robustness in Evolutionary Algorithms}
The aim of this research work is to improve robustness in evolutionary algorithms.  In this field, robustness means that an algorithm can be used to solve many kinds of problems, with a minimum number of adjustments to address particular problems with special qualities. Also, it can mean the capability of algorithms to deal acceptably with noisy or missing data.\newline
As stated by No Free Lunch(NFL) theorem, there is no algorithm better than others over all cost functions. It means, there is no guarantee for an algorithm to work well for all functions if it shows promising results for a particular category of them. Therefore, robustness has been one of the most desired features which motivates researchers to invent new methods which are less dependent on the kind of a problem than others.\newline

\section{Thesis Contribution}
In the thesis, I am going to improve the robustness of Cultural Algorithms in both components of poplation and belief spaces. In the population space, a new neighborhood restructuring strategy is proposed which works based on a dynamic and irregular topology. In the belief space, a new normative knowledge source is proposed on Confidence Interval inspired form Inferential Statistics. Talk about IEEE-CEC2015 \cdots
