ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
\end{center}

I would like to express the deepest appreciation to my supervisor Dr. Ziad Kobti, who has the attitude and the substance of a genius: he continually and convincingly conveyed a spirit of adventure regarding research and scholarship and excitement with teaching. Without his guidance and persistent help, this thesis would not have been possible.
\newline
\par I would like to thank my committee members, Dr. Mehdi Kargar and Dr. Kemal Tepe as the internal and external readers respectively for their support and positive attitude towards my research work.
\newline
\par I appreciate Mrs. Gloria Mensah, the secretary of the director and Mrs. Karen Bourdeau, the graduate secretary for their help and support whenever I needed any assistance in academic issues.
\par Finally, I would like to thank my family and friends for their unconditional support in every step of my life.

%one's centre of life inside of one's self, not
%selfishly or excludingly, but with a kind of
%unassailable serenity-to decorate one's inner house
%so richly that one is content there, glad to welcome
%any one who wants to come and stay, but happy all
%the same in the hours when one is inevitably alone.}
